About




The MSAL library for JavaScript enables client-side JavaScript applications to authenticate users using 

Azure AD

 work and school accounts (AAD), Microsoft personal accounts (MSA) and social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft accounts, etc. through 

Azure AD B2C

 service. It also enables your app to get tokens to access 

Microsoft Cloud

 services such as 

Microsoft Graph

.




The 

@azure/msal-react

 package described by the code in this folder uses the 

@azure/msal-browser

 package

 as a peer dependency to enable authentication in Javascript Single-Page Applications without backend servers. This version of the library uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. To read more about this protocol, as well as the differences between implicit flow and authorization code flow, see the section in the 

@azure/msal-browser readme

.




Prerequisites










@azure/msal-react

 is meant to be used in 

Single-Page Application scenarios

.










Before using 

@azure/msal-react

 you will need to 

register a Single Page Application in Azure AD

 to get a valid 

clientId

 for configuration, and to register the routes that your app will accept redirect traffic on.
