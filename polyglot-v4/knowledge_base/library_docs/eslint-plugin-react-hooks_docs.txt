eslint-plugin-react-hooks




This ESLint plugin enforces the 

Rules of Hooks

.




It is a part of the 

Hooks API

 for React.




Installation




Note: If you're using Create React App, please use 

react-scripts

 >= 3 instead of adding it directly.




Assuming you already have ESLint installed, run:




#

 npm


npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev



#

 yarn


yarn add eslint-plugin-react-hooks --dev




Then extend the recommended eslint config:




{


  

"extends"

: 

[


    

// ...


    

"plugin:react-hooks/recommended"


  

]




}




Custom Configuration




If you want more fine-grained configuration, you can instead add a snippet like this to your ESLint configuration file:




{


  

"plugins"

: 

[


    

// ...


    

"react-hooks"


  

]

,


  

"rules"

: 

{


    

// ...


    

"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks"

: 

"error"

,


    

"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps"

: 

"warn"


  

}




}




Advanced Configuration




exhaustive-deps

 can be configured to validate dependencies of custom Hooks with the 

additionalHooks

 option.
This option accepts a regex to match the names of custom Hooks that have dependencies.




{


  

"rules"

: 

{


    

// ...


    

"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps"

: 

[

"warn"

,

 

{


      

"additionalHooks"

: 

"(useMyCustomHook|useMyOtherCustomHook)"


    

}

]


  

}




}




We suggest to use this option 

very sparingly, if at all

. Generally saying, we recommend most custom Hooks to not use the dependencies argument, and instead provide a higher-level API that is more focused around a specific use case.




Valid and Invalid Examples




Please refer to the 

Rules of Hooks

 documentation and the 

Hooks FAQ

 to learn more about this rule.
