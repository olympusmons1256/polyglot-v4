Add Firebase to your JavaScript project











          
          Stay organized with collections
        





          
          Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
        































Follow this guide to use the Firebase JavaScript SDK in your web app or as a client for
end-user access, for example, in a Node.js desktop or IoT application.




Step 1

: Create a Firebase project and register your app




Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to create a
Firebase project and register your app with that project. When you register your
app with Firebase, you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you'll use to
connect your app with your Firebase project resources.




Note:

 Upgrading from the version 8 Firebase SDK? Check out our 

upgrade
guide

.




Visit 

Understand Firebase Projects

 to learn more
about Firebase projects and best practices for adding apps to projects.










Create a Firebase project













In the 

Firebase console

, click 

Add project

.










To add Firebase resources to an 

existing

 Google Cloud project, enter its
           project name or select it from the dropdown menu.










To create a new project, enter the desired project name. You can also optionally
           edit the project ID displayed below the project name.




Firebase generates a unique ID for your Firebase project
           based upon the name you give it. If you want to edit this project ID, you must
           do it now as it cannot be altered after Firebase provisions resources for your
           project. Visit
           

Understand Firebase Projects

 to
           learn about how Firebase uses the project ID.
         
















If prompted, review and accept the 

Firebase terms

.










Click 

Continue

.










(Optional)

 Set up Google Analytics for your project, which enables you
      to have an optimal experience using any of the following Firebase products:
















Firebase Crashlytics




Firebase Cloud Messaging
















Firebase In-App Messaging




Firebase Remote Config
















Remote Config personalization




Firebase A/B Testing
















Either select an existing
      

Google Analytics account


      or to create a new account.




If you create a new account, select your
      

Analytics reporting location

, then accept
      the data sharing settings and Google Analytics terms for your project.




You can always set up Google Analytics later in the
      

Integrations


      tab of your 

settings

 

Project settings

.
    










Click 

Create project

 (or 

Add Firebase

, if you're using an
      existing Google Cloud project).










Firebase automatically provisions resources for your Firebase project. When
  the process completes, you'll be taken to the overview page for your Firebase
  project in the Firebase console.













Register your app







After you have a Firebase project, you can register your web app with that project.










In the center of the 

Firebase console's project
        overview
        page

, click the 

Web

 icon
      (

plat_web

)
      to launch the setup workflow.
    




If you've already added an app to your Firebase project, click 

Add app

 to
      display the platform options.
    










Enter your app's nickname.


      This nickname is an internal, convenience identifier and is only visible to
      you in the Firebase console.










Click 

Register app

.










Follow the on-screen instructions to add and initialize the Firebase SDK in your app.




You can also find more detailed instructions for adding, initializing, and using the Firebase
      SDK in the next steps of this getting started page.
    













If you don't already have a JavaScript project and just want to try out a
Firebase product, you can download one of our 

quickstart samples

.




Step 2

: Install the SDK and initialize Firebase




This page describes setup instructions for the Firebase JS SDK's modular API,
which uses a 

JavaScript Module

 
format.




This workflow uses npm and requires module bundlers or JavaScript framework
tooling because the modular API is optimized to work with


module bundlers


to eliminate unused code (tree-shaking) and decrease SDK size.




Note:

 Using the modular API is strongly recommended, especially for production apps.
If you need support for calling the API in other ways, like 

window.firebase

,
see 

Upgrade from the namespaced API to the modular API


or 

Alternative ways to add Firebase

.







Install Firebase using npm:




npm install firebase




Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:





import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's 

Firebase project configuration


const firebaseConfig = {
  //...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);





A Firebase App is a container-like object that stores common configuration
and shares authentication across Firebase services. After you initialize a
Firebase App object in your code, you can add and start using Firebase
services.




If your app includes dynamic features based on server-side rendering (SSR),
you'll need to take some additional steps to ensure that your configuration
persists across server rendering and client rendering passes. In
your server logic, implement the


FirebaseServerApp

 interface to
optimize your app's


session management with service workers

.




Do you use ESM and want to use browser modules?
  Replace all your 

import

 lines to use the following
  pattern:




import { } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.12.3/firebase-

SERVICE

.js'




(where 

SERVICE

 is an SDK name such as
  

firebase-firestore

).

  

Using browser modules is a quick way to get started, but we
    recommend using a module bundler for production.
  










Step 3

: Access Firebase in your app




Firebase services (like Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Realtime Database,
Remote Config, and more) are available to import within individual
sub-packages.




The example below shows how you could use the Cloud Firestore Lite SDK to retrieve
a list of data.





import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore/lite';
// Follow this pattern to import other Firebase services
// import { } from 'firebase/<service>';

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's 

Firebase project configuration


const firebaseConfig = {
  //...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

// Get a list of cities from your database
async function getCities(db) {
  const citiesCol = collection(db, 'cities');
  const citySnapshot = await getDocs(citiesCol);
  const cityList = citySnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data());
  return cityList;
}





Step 4

: Use a module bundler (webpack/Rollup) for size reduction




Note:

 You can skip this step if you are using a JavaScript framework CLI tool
like the 

Angular CLI

, 

Next.js

,


Vue CLI

, or 

Create React
App

. Check out 

our guide
on module bundling

 for more information.




The Firebase Web SDK is designed to work with module bundlers to remove any
unused code (tree-shaking). We strongly recommend using this approach for
production apps. Tools such as the 

Angular CLI

,


Next.js

, 

Vue CLI

, or 

Create
React App

 automatically
handle module bundling for libraries installed through npm and imported into
your codebase.




See our guide 

Using module bundlers with Firebase

 for more information.




Available Firebase services for web




Now that you're setup to use Firebase, you can start adding and using any of the
following available Firebase services in your web app.







The following commands show how to import Firebase libraries installed locally
with 

npm

. For alternative import options, see the


available libraries documentation
